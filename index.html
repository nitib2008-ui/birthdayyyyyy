    <p> this was august 13 2024. i remember this day vividly when
      you were taking your hair out with me on facetime. it made me so
      happy to be with you while you were doing that and makes me so
      happy every time because i get to be a part of the little things 
      in your life.    
    </p>

    <p> this was august 21 2024. it was during school tenth period when 
      we decided to sit in the cafeteria lol. and your friends were there 
      and they were looking at you. it was also when sumira saw us and gave me 
      the inspiration to write that poem about our black fits blending. idk if you
      remember the poem but i loved it so much. it reminds me we are one.

    <p> thisss obviously was september 8 2024. i remember how happy and nervous i was this day
      when we finally made it official, even though we did a day ago lol. i remember 
      still feeling everything from the day before. and being so hopeful and excited to see you. 
      to just be doing mundane things together like going to the library and getting groceries. 
      i love you and im still so in love with you a year and almost half later jed.

      we have ever matched honestly. i remember thats when i did soft launch with you. and this
      picture was the cutest thing ever. the way im looking at you alone should tell you all the feelings
      i feel about you.

    <p> okayyy this one was october 12 2024. homecoming day. althoughhh there were 
      some bumps in the road before we saw each other. i think it really reminded me that
       no matter what, we could get over a bad moment with just some communication and forgiveness
      and we could still end up having the most amazing time together. and i had exactly that the most
      amazing time with you and im so grateful i did. and you looked so very handsome. especially that picture
      i took of you on my digital camera lol. </p>

    hi my love. happy nineteenth birthday. i hope your day has been so amazing. i love you so much. i know the last few months haven't been easy. i know yesterday wasn't easy and 
    im very sorry if that ruined your birthday day at all. i know we have had a lot of downs lately, and it's been hard on both of us. but i do think we have also grown closer in some sense
    idk but i just feel it. i feel like i still fall more and more in love with you everyday. and i want us to be okay. i want to give you and our relationship every piece of myself and all my 
    energy. i don't want to give up on us or you. i cannot imagine losing you lol. it hasn't been easy for me as you can imagine, there are a lot of thoughts in my head. but at the end of the day 
    it is truly because i care about you and us. i don't want it to not be us. i've known you so closely for the last year and a half, and even then i've known you for over two years now. and even if 
    i'm just being naive or whatever, i truly do feel like i know you. i know when you're sad just by looking at you. i know if there's something on your mind. i feel like at any given moment i could guess the 
    next words that would come out of your mouth. and so i choose to trust you still and give you my heart. i want to believe that you are the man that i have gotten to know everything about for the past two years. 
    i want to believe that i really do know you because i love everything about you. every little thing. i love your love for music. i could listen to talk about music for hours and hours. i could listen to play the piano 
    or drums or guitar for hours. and listen to you teach me about music theory. i love your love and commitment to your family, especially how much you love your brother. i love all the random little things you know 
    and i love listening to you tell me about it. i love your love for rock climbing lol. i loved going with you and i hope i can go again. it was genuinely very fun and i love spending time with you. i love your 
    beautiful smile and laugh and eyes and hair and face and body. from head to toe. im so in love with you lol. sigh its been so long with you and i cant believe you're turning or i guess turned 19 lol. like whattt you're almost twenty
    a fullll adult man. i genuinely hope you have a great year jed. i know this year hasn't been easy at all. i know that i dont know everything but still i know. and i hope you get to take care of yourself next year. 
    i hope you grow from the things you have gone through this year and just learn. i hope you do think about the things you're doing and get to understand yourself better. and i hope you are happy with where you are. and i mean that
    mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and academically. in all the ways there are, i hope this year brings you peace. i really hope it will be an amazing year for you. and i hope i get to see that growth along side you. 
    i do want the best for you and i always will no matter what. i will always love you and always be in your corner wishing you the best through love and hurt. happy nineteenth birthday. i truly hope you make it worth it. and i hope you
    remain true to yourself. i hope you stay true to your values and who you are, continue to grow, and take on the opportunities given to you and seek them as well. i love you jed and happy birthday. i miss you and i wish i could be 
    there with you, and spending it with you. ❤️
